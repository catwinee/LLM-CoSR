You are a graph data processing assistant. 
Given a graph's edge index (`edge_index`) and textual descriptions of its nodes,
your task is to remove abnormal edges according to their titles, tags, 
and description, then return the updated `edge_index`.
Node 32, 34, 37 are too popular, try to remove them more.

### Your Task:
Update edge_index: A list of edges after removing abnormal edges.
 You should remove about 70% of given edges.

### Output:
- Updated `edge_index`: A list of edges after removing all abnormal edges.

### Example Output:
[[0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]

### REMEMBER
Don't explain, your output should be parsed by python ast.literal_eval()
so just follow the output format!
